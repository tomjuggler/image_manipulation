# Utility scripts for the Magic Poi project

1. Pixelate.py - compresses image to .bin format using r3g3b2 byte compression (8 bit)
2. depixelate.py - uncompress and view .bin files for poi
3. rotate.py - rotates the image (90 degrees clockwise), needed for display on poi
4. resize.py - resize image, example is for 72px poi
5. RotateImageVisualPoiStyle.py - python version of a Processing script to view what the image looks like on the poi. Rotates, re-sizes and generates an image. Implemented at the magic poi site as an api now.
